# PbmDrawer
A simple application to create images in [.pbm format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format#PBM_example).

This kind of images are useful for programming beginers:
* You can create maps for your first game
* You're able to create simple images for MachineLearning (pbm files are very easy to process)

<br/>

**What is cool** <br/>
You can enable the "fast saving" mode, in which your images will be saved immediately after you release the mouse button. It's very helpful specially when you need to create a lot of very simple images.

<br/>

**How to get it** <br/>
You just need to download the zip file with [the newest release](https://github.com/grudus/PbmDrawer/releases).
Remember, the `res` folder must be in the same directory as jar file.

**Previews** <br/>
